ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification â€” Decision Tree (Python Project)
This project uses a Decision Tree classifier to categorize Iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” based on their petal and sepal dimensions. It is a simple machine learning classification task ideal for beginners.

Train a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn

Visualize the decision tree using graphviz

Predict and evaluate model performance

ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Install dependencies (if not already installed):

bash

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib graphviz


ðŸ§ª Sample Output
Console will print model accuracy.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset (iris.csv) contains 150 samples with the following columns:

sepal_length

sepal_width

petal_length

petal_width

species (label)
